# Multisignature Wallets in Solidity

## Overview
Multisignature wallets are a type of smart contract in Ethereum, designed to require multiple signatures before executing a transaction. This approach adds an extra layer of security for the assets stored in the wallet.

## Key Features
- **Multiple Signatories**: Requires more than one person to agree on a transaction.
- **Increased Security**: Reduces the risk of theft or unauthorized access.
- **Flexible**: Can be customized for different numbers of signatures and complex rules.

## Typical Functions in a Multisignature Wallet

| Function Name       | Description                                             |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `addOwner`          | Adds a new owner to the wallet.                         |
| `removeOwner`       | Removes an existing owner from the wallet.              |
| `replaceOwner`      | Replaces an existing owner with a new one.              |
| `submitTransaction` | Submits a transaction proposal to the wallet.           |
| `confirmTransaction`| Allows an owner to confirm a submitted transaction.     |
| `revokeConfirmation`| Allows an owner to revoke their confirmation.           |
| `executeTransaction`| Executes a transaction after enough confirmations.      |
| `getConfirmationCount`| Returns the number of confirmations for a transaction.|
| `isConfirmed`       | Checks if a transaction is confirmed by required owners.|
| `changeRequirement` | Changes the required number of confirmations for a transaction. |

## Usage Scenario
In a typical scenario, a transaction is proposed by one of the owners through `submitTransaction`. Other owners then use `confirmTransaction` to approve it. Once the required number of confirmations is reached, the transaction can be executed using `executeTransaction`.
